By no means are we attempting to minimize an individual’s experience, but we are at a loss to understand why several employees who left our company as far back as 2016 would suddenly decide to begin posting negative comments now. We operate in an intensely competitive environment and attacks on social media/user forums have proven to be an effective way of tortiously interfering with someone’s business. The normal responses to this type of activity, such as litigation, are ineffective because of the time and cost involved and the inability for the truth to catch up with misinformation/disinformation.

Our company has an internal Human Resources Department and written policies regarding issues such as sexual harassment, intimidation or retaliation. Multiple women hold senior leadership roles throughout our organization, in addition to a diverse and inclusive global workforce.

Since its inception in 1999, we have employed more than 850 employees and interns. During this time our company has never been the subject of a complaint or litigation regarding these issues and has never been the subject of a complaint to the EEOC regarding sexual harassment. Additionally, we have no record of internal complaints by the employees who have been posting on these forums regarding their time with the company which ended years ago.

Any company, individual or organization can become the subject of an unfair or inaccurate attack on social media or these user forums. The attackers have no real fear of retribution and there is no third-party fact checking concerning their posts.
No organization is perfect, and we are certainly making every effort to ensure that our employees are aware of our policies and have multiple avenues to raise concerns.
