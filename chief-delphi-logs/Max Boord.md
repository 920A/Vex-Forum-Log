I apologize for keeping my identity private. I know it is against the forum rules, but I have had enough dealings regarding this person, that I really don’t want to rehash it with new people. However I feel that I have to bring this topic up, because it has come to my attention that he is still to this day involved in FIRST and interacting with students, and thank you to met for showing me that this can be done.

Max Boord is a child predator. He has on numerous times attempted to coerce students from various teams into forming close relationships with him and more.

This took place when I was 14-15 and Max was somewhere between 22-25, I do not know exactly how old he is now. I was the lead (and frankly only) design student on my FRC team. Max approached me online offering to help design robot parts for me. He promised that he could help my team win a blue banner, a team that had never won anything until then. I was instantly excited. This was Max Boord, a member of the community who was active on Chief Delphi, various slack groups, and discord groups. He was known for being an expert cader and a part of multiple teams.

I openly invited him to our team in hopes that it would help us win. He started giving us design tips, helping direct how things should be done, and even cading entire parts of the robot and telling us to just build it and we will win in the upcoming season. This went on for a few months, and eventually he started even telling me that he would fly out to where we were (since he was not local) to attend our competitions in person and help us out. I was excited to have an experienced mentor with us.

It was about then that he started being overly inappropriate. Looking back on it as an adult, there were signs way earlier that I should have caught on to and alerted someone. But I failed to do so and fell into his trap. He asked for my snapchat and started sending me snapchats daily, to which I would respond because I thought he was just being friendly. But he started commenting on my looks and my body. It initially started out with simple compliments like complementing what makeup I was wearing, but eventually he grew bold enough to directly call my breasts and behind as attractive.

The final straw before I finally realized I needed to get help was when he asked me to send him a picture of myself naked. When I initially refused and laughed it off, he pressed harder and even implied that if I did not do it, he would stop helping my team and would not help my team win a banner.

I have reported this to many people back in the day, including FIRST itself, but it never went anywhere significant. I know he was officially banned from FIRST, but clearly that didn’t affect him at all and he just went to yet another team.

These are all second hand stories so take them as you will:
I have been told/he has claimed he has been a part of several teams over the years, including 233, 1477, 1902, 1369, and others. He has been kicked off several of those teams due to further inappropriate behavior including behaving inappropriately with students both online and physically in person (which thankfully I never had to experience), and including one team for abusing drugs with or around students.

Today I found out via a couple of people on the Major FRC Discord, that Max Boord is with yet another team. I have included the screenshots I was sent below regarding the team he is currently helping.

I really hope this post does not get taken down. I and several others have already tried to handle this privately, but clearly it does not do anything since he is continuing to be a part of FRC. His story is known amongst the active online community, but not amongst outsiders, and that is how he continues to be a part of more and more teams. If this gets taken down, it is only ensuring that he continues his behavior.
