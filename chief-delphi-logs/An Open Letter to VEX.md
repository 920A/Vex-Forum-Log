To those here who are commenting about the Glassdoor reviews, as an ex VEX employee, I will openly state that the culture was sexist and homophobic. Folks openly made some racist jokes at the time and during my time there, I saw plenty of gaslighting, horrific behavior from management, and was gaslit myself specifically by my boss at the time.

I am writing this post to our forum out of a sincere request to all FRC suppliers, namely VEX Robotics. There are many quality control failures from other product lines from VEX and other suppliers, however, I believe Falcon 500 to be the most egregious and widespread by far.

Falcon 500s were announced over three years ago – October 31st, 2019. Featured in that announcement was Field Oriented Control (FOC): a technology that was advertised as a game changer, and was unavailable on any motors in FRC. It supposedly wasn’t quite ready at release, but was promised to be added to Falcons in a later firmware update. However, three years later, there has been complete radio silence about whether this is ever coming. Despite this, it is still being advertised to this day. People who were freshmen when Falcons were announced are now going into their final season as a student. Almost an entire FIRST generation has passed, yet many of the issues at release still persist.

The initial Falcon release was difficult enough - there were no order limits, so high-budget teams that could swipe a card immediately could be first in line and buy dozens of falcons, while low-budget teams that had to go through their schools waited months into season to get theirs. VEX should have done a maximum order for the first round, with uncapped ordering coming only when they had the supply to support it (which they still do not, considering they have been out of stock for months).

A few months after the first Falcons were received, teams started having issues with Falcon shafts not having threadlocker properly applied. Already, this is a serious QC issue, and from the beginning, I do not feel like VEX did enough. VEX did not offer any threadlocker and teams with broken Falcons did not get them replaced, not to mention VEX put the onus on teams to repair their own Falcons and didn’t offer to swap known good falcons with the likely bad ones teams had received. In my opinion, these things would have been the bare minimum, followed by VEX fixing whatever led to this becoming an issue in the first place.

Two years later, the exact same issues were discovered - they had never been resolved. VEX again failed to do any of the things I listed above, except this time, they promised to personally inspect the Falcons, something they failed to do. Following this, Falcons were also received without their housing, without bearings, and screws unable to withstand normal use. VEX did sell a fix, however, it did not address all the issues, and, in my opinion, it is unacceptable that they would sell repairs to such egregious issues as this for a profit.

This isn’t a problem exclusive to Falcons either. Ever since I started FRC, VEX has consistently had poor quality control. I have personally heard of teams receiving VersaFrame with 7/8” hole spacing, which were advertised as 1”, VersaFrame stock entirely missing the hole pattern, oversized Thunderhex shaft, undersized Falcon 500 pinions, oversized Falcon 500 shafts, and mislabeled products. This resulted in teams receiving something completely different than what was ordered. Any of these in isolation are very forgivable, but together, they show a complete lack of quality control, going back years.

Regarding business practices, I have a personal story. This past season my team needed a large amount of 26 teeth gears, 20 to be exact. VEX made a mistake and sent us 40, while charging us for the 20 we initially ordered. However, a few weeks later the lead mentor received a $240 charge on his personal credit card, and an email stating that he had to return the gears and they would refund his card. This is illegal, [according to the FTC](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products#unordered). However, we didn’t fight it, because we were worried about upsetting a company that we still rely on.

Overall, I am disappointed by the poor quality control I have consistently seen from VEX. My hope is they make substantial changes to improve their system across all product lines, not just Falcon 500s. The intent of this post is not to drive VEX out of business, as I believe they have done a lot of good for the FIRST community, but I think things still have room to improve.

Best,
Ethan Ocker

Re-made an account here just for this post. It was pointed out to me by an old buddy. Some of what’s been described is consistent with my experience so here I am, posting. Gonna keep myself as anonymous as possible, because of the culture, which means I’m going to leave specifics out.
Short version. I was at VEX. I was bullied. Never even went to management about it because I thought the kind of stuff folks were saying around me, and to me, was normal. This was my first gig, my first big break in engineering. Got the idea after being there and seeing the culture, that “oh, this is what engineering really is” and nearly quit the business entirely because of it. My mental health took a swan dive, which made me perform poorly at work, which added more possibilities to the ways I could be insulted and my worth questioned. There was a general lack of offers to help, except from a few individuals. There was a general lack of support if you were having a rough time, except from a few individuals. There was a general lack of acceptance for being different (as in not of the culture), from many individuals. The people that I remember being kind to me, I can count on a single hand. They were fantastic to me in what turned out to be a very rough time. I’m making this post partially because of them, because if they come across this thread, they’ll know who they are and I wanted them to know they were appreciated. Because I needed them and I needed more of them, in that time and place. But I won’t identify them, or anyone who wasn’t one of them. I’m not here to harm anybody. I just want to tell the truth.

Well this thread dragged me out of CD-retirement when it showed up in my email feed, and the politics surrounding Team IFI and the CEO/founder have always been something I’ve avoided talking about publicly because of how uncomfortable it’s made me. I never worked at IFI (although I had a number of friends who did) and haven’t been a part of an FRC team for a few years now.

I started with FRC in 2009, and I’ve had the chance to experience quite a lot as a student and mentor. I’ve met a lot of the celebrities of the era in more informal settings, and all of them seemed to be pretty upstanding people. Talking to Andy Baker, I got the impression that he was truly interested in producing quality products that FRC teams need, and never once did he talk down about a competitor’s product. I didn’t get to meet Greg Needel (REV’s founder), but the other representatives of REV have had similar professional discipline to Andy when talking about their products and their competitors.

I’ve never met Tony Norman (IFI’s founder), but the first time I heard of him was a description of the parties held by the VRC GDC. Apparently he liked to invite the entire GDC to his house for a huge party, and was very proud to show off his new large gun vault with his wife posing in it. That year’s GDC produced the game ‘Sack Attack’, which some GDC members found to be inappropriately named, but VEX went with it anyway. I have no idea the internals of the decisions behind this, how the ‘internal’ name stuck, if Tony liked it, etc.

I’ve also heard stories of IFI interns throwing sacks at each other around the office inappropriately, and the comments I’ve heard from distant friends of mine who have worked there all line up with what Nikki has said. The whole company is built around a toxic culture that comes from the top. None of them still work there, and all of them have found great success since leaving.

The last time I heard about Tony was around the time I was leaving FRC. He made a ‘hit list’ of Team IFI members who had used NEO motors on their robots in 2019 (before the Falcons were available), and threatened us all with loss of sponsorship if we continued using REV’s products. In fact, we’d heard of this indirectly via CTRE even earlier during the 2019 build season, and they recommended that we redesign our robot to not include NEOs before Tony heard about it. We had already manufactured too many parts and just couldn’t fit anything else, but did legitimately start design work on that path, taking it as a very real and legitimate threat. I’d later learn that the only reason Tony didn’t pull sponsorship was because nearly all of the Team IFI teams were using NEOs. NEOs were absolutely off the table in 2020, despite the stock we had and issues with the Falcons.

Around that same time, at one of the last competitions I attended, I had a very interesting conversation with a CTRE executive who I’d known and respected for many years. In short, he said to me ‘We’re happy we’re late to the brushless market because our competitor has set the bar so low’. I haven’t followed FRC in great detail since, but this thread certainly isn’t an indication that the Falcon was the far-superior product, and I was offended at how arrogantly and openly he talked about his yet-unreleased product against the competitors.

That’s basically the point where I really felt uncomfortable continuing to be involved so heavily with FRC, and the politics of working on a Team IFI team. I’ve known a lot of amazing role models in FRC, from mentors to company owners, and none have rubbed me the wrong way as hard as IFI and CTRE.

Want to clear this up a bit and add some additional context from around the same time I was also on 33 with Andrew.

From my understanding, it was not Tony who made the list of #TeamIFI teams that used NEOs. It was another person high up at IFI and heavily involved in FRC who made the list and presented it to Tony. I do not know this definitively as I did not work at IFI, but I believe this is what happened.

I don’t remember us doing any redesign work to switch to any other motors from NEOs in 2019 like Andrew stated. I was pretty heavily involved in the design of that robot so I think I would remember this. There simply would have been no way to fit minicims etc onto that robot by that point anyway, which Andrew correctly stated. It is definitely correct that we had heard that IFI was not happy about our use of NEOs. Jim, myself, and the rest of the mentor group on 33 did not see a reason this would make sense, as there simply was no other motor in the market at the time to match the performance of the NEO. We had used products from other vendors all the time if we felt it necessary for our design, using the NEOs did not feel any different here.

Hearing through Jim, it definitely seemed like it was clear for 2020 we were not to use NEOs now that Falcons were available. I remember us having a conversation about using Neo550s since those came out before 2020 as well, and the conclusion was using them would not be worth the potential backlash from IFI, even though once again the n550 was a unique motor that did not have an equivalent in the market.

The last thing I’ll add on here is more directly personal for me. During the summer of 2020, I worked on the development of a vectored intake wheel which would eventually become the one that The ThriftyBot would end up selling beginning in the fall of 2020. I really liked the work Ryan was doing with TTB, and I approached him about the wheel once I felt I had it to a good place and somewhere that would make sense for him. Working with him on that went really well, and he and I started having conversations about other potential products, sadly none of which materialized.

However, when the Falcon came out, both he and I had the same initial reaction about the removable shaft. We were surprised given this feature that they didn’t offer an 8mm keyed shaft option to easily work with existing product even they themselves still sold. We both agreed this seems like a no brainier, so that Friday night of the release I designed up a part for TTB to sell, and Ryan got to work on getting it produced. This became the [8mm Keyed Motor Output Shaft](https://www.thethriftybot.com/bearings/8mm-Keyed-Motor-Output-Shaft-p157387731) still sold today.

Fats forward to a month or so later once Ryan released the shaft, and I am at the 33 shop with Jim after a meeting. He and I were just talking or cleaning up or something, when he got a call from someone in a high position at IFI. It was made clear that they were not happy with my public involvement with TTB, especially the motor shaft, and that they would like for my involvement to not be so public, or at least the connection to 33 not as clear. I can’t say I was totally surprised by this, as I had heard when I worked on the design of the shaft that apparently AndyMark had developed the same thing but were told not to sell it. Again, I didn’t work at IFI or AM so I cannot confirm any of that, but that’s what I had been told. So it was not surprising to me that IFI was not happy about TTB selling one, especially after Ryan had been undercutting their consumables left and right.

To this day, I am very thankful for Jim and his character. When he got off that call and told me about it, I made it clear that I would not stop doing something in my personal/professional life just because IFI didn’t like it. I even said I could disconnect from the team if it caused issues for him and the team. Jim was supportive and told me no way and to not worry about it. I’ll always be thankful to Jim for the support he has shown me, and the guidance I’ve gotten from him many times, from multiple job moves, to product ideas and reviews, to just plain life advice.

I was going to stay out of this thread, as I didn’t really want anything personally for me to get involved in this. But I felt it right to correct a couple things Andrew said and also back up what he said overall. I also realized people not speaking up about these negative experiences is what allows them to continue. Thanks to Nikki and others who have spoken up about their experiences. I have other experiences from my times volunteering at vex worlds that ended up having some negative effects for me, but I’ll leave it there.

\*Disclaimer: I did work for REV for a period of time after everything I discussed and mentioned above.

I appreciate friends for sharing this post with me, it forced me to dust off my CD login and deal with some unfortunate realities in this community.

I was hired as an IFI intern to work on product development as part of HEXBUG in the summer of 2011, and while I can agree with Tyler that my internship provided me with plenty of valuable knowledge and working experience. The 4.5 years that followed were far from ideal, incredibly toxic, and deeply unhealthy. So, I am a little disappointed to hear your comment on culture, knowing the conversations we have had in the past.

As far as interns, I was one of the first in what has now become a normal operating procedure across IFI, hiring college interns & co-ops instead of Engineers to reduce cost. This is certainly part of what amplified the boys club atmosphere that already existed at IFI. Older employees talked about how there used to be Playboy magazines in the bathrooms, and younger interns were joking about an IFI fraternity. At the top of all of this is the overlying Issue with IFI, Tony Norman.

Unless the Finances of IFI have changed, Tony is a 51% owner, as compared to Bob’s 49%. This gives Tony complete decision-making authority and leaves no true in-road for others to improve the culture. It’s also the answer as to why IFI has a Jet… It finances it for Tony.

I unfortunately have too many stories I could share, and many of those I wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing on CD, and with this audience. But I will share a few different observations from my time at IFI.

An employee once went to ‘HR’ about an inappropriate comment Tony had made regarding her weight… He came back later that day and berated her for 15 minutes about it at her desk.

At one point A female intern was approached by 3 different executives, and her own boss, about how it would be beneficial for her to go out to dinner alone with Tony.

I had two friends who were both verbally abused and threatened with violence, by Tony, while at work.

Imagine looking up from a discussion with a co-worker, only to see a senior VEX employee with p*rn on his screen.

After having an ex-wife sign their divorce paperwork in his office, Tony made it clear everyone should come to the front desk to toast his divorce. He also had her car tracked after the divorce, forcing her to sell it shortly thereafter.

In my time at IFI, I heard of and witnessed much worse than this, and took a lot of responsibility upon myself to protect as many younger individuals as possible. The stress did cause a severe mental breakdown, and PTSD that I am still dealing with through therapy 6 years later. I worked with a lot of incredible individuals that did their best to protect each other and am happy knowing that they have all moved on too much bigger and better things. I will forever be grateful for those individuals.

At the same time, I followed some of my biggest FIRST idols to IFI and was underwhelmed by the majority of who they ended up being as people. I believe Paul did great work to protect his staff during his time at VEX. I will also be forever grateful to Adam and the 9 months he was my manager; he gave me hope in good people with great leadership and drive. I just wish he’d listened when we told him not to take the job. Adam and Paul were the only executives at IFI that were supportive and believed in me when I quit, they never once asked me to stay on even though I had nothing lined up for my career.

Over the years since leaving IFI I have taken small steps to protect future students by reaching out to schools that had worked with IFI through Co-op programs, as well as reaching out and discussing these issues with people at FIRST HQ. But to say that this hasn’t come with fear of repercussion as well would be silly, I spent a year discussing my own legal fears with a few lawyers before ever taking a step forward. Even so, I was still incredibly uneasy simply showing up at FIRST Worlds this year.

Regards,
Jay

and on a wildly less important note:
It is my belief that the QC issues being seen across VEX products is a direct result Paul leaving VEX and Tony taking a larger role.

I was ‘nocallingcard’ above, in this thread. I guess one of the side effects of quickly created an anonymous account is if you can flub the password… and also forget the password you made to the email that you quickly made to be tied to the account… well I messed up. I didn’t expect to post again anyway. But, here’s another reply for 2 reasons.

1, because more stuff about the culture has been brought up. Specific stuff that I was around for. I’m not going to say “I was in the room for X” or “I was insulted by Y” because I still don’t wish to be identified. I won’t even say the timeframe of events I was there for. But I wanted to give some validation to the people that posted after me. I was more the butt-end of your “standard” variety exclusion, insults, and bullying, if there is a “standard” variety. Though I’ll just say a good deal of what’s been described worse than that, either (A) happened or was spoken about during my time there or (B) doesn’t surprise me given what I did see and hear.

2, because of more recent discussion of leaving the company. It got better for me after I left, in many ways. I really hope the same is true for people who had it worse than me. Staying at VEX was always at the forefront of options because I truly actually believed that there weren’t other places that would take me. I don’t think this was intentional, but… having people question your intelligence and bring you down, results in you thinking that workplace is the best you’re going to be able to get. It makes you think everything around you is normal and that you’re the lowest on the pecking order (not in the company structure but as a person). I ended up putting myself down, all on my own, to sort of pre-empt the comments of others. I ended up feeling powerless. It was a while before I realized that wasn’t true, and it wasn’t until I started my next gig after that it clicked in my brain. I felt included and appreciated and I fell in love with engineering again. My boss at the next place told me “[MY NAME], if you ever have a choice between making a deposit or a withdrawal from the bank that is your personal health and happiness, always make a deposit.” Because there were withdrawals from that bank for the entire time I was at VEX and I didn’t even know it. Since then I’ve had the chance to have my own interns and my own engineers under me. I’ve given them the same advice my first post-VEX boss gave me, and seeing them love their work in ways that I couldn’t in my early career… that’s helped me the most. I really do hope others who have moved on have found something that helped them, too. I wish you all the best of luck and the happiest of life.
