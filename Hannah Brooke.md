In light of many other people within this community sharing their stories I decided to share my own. From April of 2022 to early August of 2022 I was groomed by the former lead developer of PROS Hannah Brooke, more commonly known as hotel ([HotelCalifornia (Hannah Brooke) · GitHub](https://github.com/HotelCalifornia)). I am 16 she is 24. We met through the VRC discord where when I made some jokes she reached out in dms. Almost immediately on that first day she turned the conversation slightly sexual with the comment “smh why are you too young”. She was fully aware of my age at the time. We started talking more regularly and the conversations escalated more and more. I did not fully comprehend that they were escalating at the time as it was gradual. She would often send pictures of her thighs though never anything explicitly sexual. This continued until I finally realized what had happened and I reported her to the staff of the vrc discord and she was banned. The PROS dev team also took action and removed her status as a contributor. However, the general community does not know about this and I decided I wanted to share what happened.

Dear VEX Community,

Regarding the sexual misconduct from Hannah Brooke (aka. hotel), the former lead developer for PROS up until 2020: we have no tolerance for this behavior at all, which is why she was removed from the PROS Development Team and the VRC Discord back in July, as soon as we were able to take action a few hours after we were informed. She no longer has any association with the PROS Development Team, Purdue SIGBots, or the VEX community.

Thank you for having the courage to share your story publicly. The VRC community has no tolerance for this behavior, and we hope that through sharing your story, it is clear that this community is insistent on believing victims and taking steps to prevent anything like this from occurring in the future. If anyone else has experienced this kind of behavior or experiences it in the future, speak up. Reach out to your adult leaders, forum/discord moderators, etc. so that the behavior is stopped and no one else is hurt in this manner.

We chose not to make any public statements back in July in the interest of protecting the minors involved. We felt that it was not our place to divulge the details of the incident to the community, rather that it was up to the victims to decide how much of the situation they wanted in the public eye. We ask that the community respect the privacy of the victims and not push them more than they wish about details regarding the situation.

Sincerely,
The PROS Development Team
