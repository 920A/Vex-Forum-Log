On behalf of the REC Foundation, I want to acknowledge the comments and concerns of the community regarding harassment and other issues at IFI. These discussions are never easy and the REC Foundation takes these concerns seriously.

First, I want to emphasize that the REC Foundation is a separate organization. We are not IFI / VEX Robotics. The REC Foundation is a 501c3 not for profit organization. We have an independent infrastructure, our own executive staff, operations, processes, HR Department, employee handbook, etc. Since 2017, we have worked deliberately to cultivate an inclusive culture to promote diversity in both our programs and within our staff. We have embraced change and proudly have a diverse staff. And we continue to challenge ourselves to do better and be better.

Additionally, the REC Foundation runs many different programs. We have Drones competitions, classroom activities, work force development initiatives including industry certifications and of course the REC Foundation VEX Robotics Competitions. The REC Foundation believes that the VEX Robotics V5 and IQ equipment are ideal for our VEX Robotics competitions because this platform allows us to provide affordable and accessible programs that allow us to reach more educator and students to give them an opportunity to engage in STEM through robotics. We do collaborate with VEX Robotics to develop the education resources and robotics kits for our programs just as we collaborate with our drones’ partners for our drones programs. This collaboration has successfully introduced robotics to hundreds of thousands of students.

But this isn’t why you are reading this post… I am fully aware of what has been communicated concerning IFI leadership. I know they are working on a response that addresses these concerns and will share with the community soon.

We all share the goals of providing an inclusive supportive workplace and to continue to successfully share our love and passion for robotics with our students.
